# ATM MACHINE SIMULATION IN PYTHON

## OVERVIEW

This project is a simulation of a basic ATM machine implemented in Python. It allows users to perform common banking operations such as checking their balance, withdrawing funds, and depositing money. The program is interactive and provides a simple user interface for better understanding.

## FEATURES

- Secure Access : Users can access the ATM system by entering a 4-digit PIN.
- Balance Inquiry : View the current account balance.
- Withdrawal : Withdraw a specified amount from the account balance.
- Deposit : Deposit money into the account and update the balance.
- Exit : Safely exit the ATM system.

## HOW IT WORKS

1. The user inserts their card (simulated with a message).
2. The program waits for 5 seconds to simulate card processing.
3. The user enters a PIN to access the ATM.
4. Once the PIN is verified, the user can choose from the following options:
   - Check Balance : Displays the current account balance.
   - Withdraw Money : Allows the user to withdraw a specified amount.
   - Deposit Money : Lets the user deposit money into their account.
   - Exit : Ends the program.

If the user enters the wrong PIN, they are denied access to the system.
